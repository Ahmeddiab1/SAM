<details><summary>Resources for learning GitHub</summary>
<p>

If you are new to GitHub, you can find helpful articles to help you learn how it works on the web. Some examples are:

* [Using the Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) from Scott's Weblog is a good introduction.

* [Git Concepts: Branches, Forks, and Pull Requests](http://willi.am/blog/2014/05/12/git-concepts-branches-forks-and-pull-requests/) from Will Anderson is useful, although the video on the page does not work.

* [3.2 Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) from the Git documentation.

* [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) from GitHub Help.

* [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) from GitHub Help.
