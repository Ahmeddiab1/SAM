When you enable retail electricity rates for the PPA Single Owner model, you create or download a rate structure to calculate the monthly cost of electricity purchased from the grid to charge the battery and meet inverter night-time consumption. This cost is treated as an annual operating expense in the project cash flow. All electricity generated by the system is sold to the grid at the PPA price, and all electricity consumed from the grid is purchased at rates defined by the rate structure, assuming there is one meter to measure sales and a separate one to measure purchases. The rate structure includes rates for fixed, energy, and demand charges, and may include time-of-use and tiered rates.
