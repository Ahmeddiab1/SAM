# 3D Shade Scene Files

This collection of .s3d files were created with SAM's 3D Shade Calculator.

To open the files, start SAM and open or create a .sam file with a Detailed Photovoltaic or PVWatts case. Click the <strong>Open 3d shade calculator</strong> button on the Shading and Snow page (Detailed Photovoltaic model), System Desing page (PVWatts model), or Solar Water Heating page (Solar Water Heating model).

To use the files in a SAM simulation, you will need to add active surfaces to represent a photovoltaic array or solar water heating collector and ensure that the dimensions, orientation and other properties of the active surface matches the parameters in SAM.

See SAM's Help system for information about how to use the 3D Shade Calculator.
